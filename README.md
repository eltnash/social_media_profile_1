## Overview

For this project, I built a simple yet elegant profile card that displayed a userâ€™s image, name, location, bio, and social links. The objective was to make the card functional, visually engaging, and flexible across different screen sizes, all while keeping the design clean and focused.


### The challenge
Users should be able to:

View hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me sharpen several key skills in responsive web design:

### Responsive Layouts: 
I used  Flexbox to create a layout that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes. This tools allowed me to focus on alignment and spacing without relying on fixed positions.

### Media Queries: 
By adding media queries, I could adjust font sizes, element spacing, and layout structure to fit mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, ensuring a consistent user experience.

### Interactive States: 
I incorporated hover effects for links and social icons, making the card interactive and visually engaging on desktop while ensuring it remained touch-friendly on mobile.

These concepts and tools are critical in modern web design and will form the foundation of my future projects.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to deepen my understanding of:

Advanced CSS Techniques: Learning more about responsive units like vw/vh and experimenting with CSS animations.
JavaScript Integration: For future projects, I plan to add more interactive functionality with JavaScript to enhance user experience.
